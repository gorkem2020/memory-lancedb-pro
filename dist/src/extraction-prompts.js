# Memory Extraction Criteria

## What is worth remembering?
- Personalized information: Information specific to this user, not general domain knowledge
- Long-term validity: Information that will still be useful in future sessions
- Specific and clear: Has concrete details, not vague generalizations

## What is NOT worth remembering?
- General knowledge that anyone would know
- System/platform metadata: message IDs, sender IDs, timestamps, channel info, JSON envelopes (e.g. "System: [timestamp] Feishu...", "message_id", "sender_id", "ou_xxx") — these are infrastructure noise, NEVER extract them
- Temporary information: One-time questions or conversations
- Vague information: "User has questions about a feature" (no specific details)
- Tool output, error logs, or boilerplate
- Runtime scaffolding or orchestration wrappers such as "[Subagent Context]", "[Subagent Task]", bootstrap wrappers, task envelopes, or agent instructions — these are execution metadata, NEVER store them as memories
- Recall queries / meta-questions: "Do you remember X?", "你还记得X吗?", "你知道我喜欢什么吗" — these are retrieval requests, NOT new information to store
- Degraded or incomplete references: If the user mentions something vaguely ("that thing I said"), do NOT invent details or create a hollow memory
- Raw conversation carryover: quoted or attributed transcript blocks, especially 3+ lines of speaker text, are not memories by themselves. Distill a concrete fact/preference/decision/entity from them or skip.
- System/runtime artifacts: content containing "System:", compaction notices, model-switch/session-reset traces, tool-call transcripts, raw JSON blobs, or similar internal execution traces must be rejected unless a clean user fact can be extracted.
- Fragment blobs: mixed filename shards, code snippets, metadata fields, or partial sentences that look like unprocessed context fragments should be skipped rather than preserved.
- Atomic memory shape: each stored memory must read like one durable fact, preference, decision, entity state, event, case, or reusable pattern. If a candidate reads like an excerpt, log, or raw transcript, compress it into one atomic statement or skip it.
- Length/distillation gate: if a candidate is longer than about 200 characters and reads like raw conversation instead of a distilled insight, rewrite it as a single factual statement before storing; if that is not possible, skip it.

# Memory Classification

## Core Decision Logic

| Question | Answer | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Who is the user? | Identity, attributes | profile |
| What does the user prefer? | Preferences, habits | preferences |
| What is this thing? | Person, project, organization | entities |
| What happened? | Decision, milestone | events |
| How was it solved? | Problem + solution | cases |
| What is the process? | Reusable steps | patterns |

## Precise Definition

**profile** - User identity (static attributes). Test: "User is..."
**preferences** - User preferences (tendencies). Test: "User prefers/likes..."
**entities** - Continuously existing nouns. Test: "XXX's state is..."
**events** - Things that happened. Test: "XXX did/completed..."
**cases** - Problem + solution pairs. Test: Contains "problem -> solution"
**patterns** - Reusable processes. Test: Can be used in "similar situations"

## Common Confusion
- "Plan to do X" -> events (action, not entity)
- "Project X status: Y" -> entities (describes entity)
- "User prefers X" -> preferences (not profile)
- "Encountered problem A, used solution B" -> cases (not events)
- "General process for handling certain problems" -> patterns (not cases)

# Three-Level Structure

Each memory contains three levels:

**abstract (L0)**: One-liner index
- Merge types (preferences/entities/profile/patterns): \`[Merge key]: [Description]\`
- Independent types (events/cases): Specific description

**overview (L1)**: Structured Markdown summary with category-specific headings

**content (L2)**: Full narrative with background and details

# Few-shot Examples

## profile
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "profile",
  "abstract": "User basic info: AI development engineer, 3 years LLM experience",
  "overview": "## Background\\n- Occupation: AI development engineer\\n- Experience: 3 years LLM development\\n- Tech stack: Python, LangChain",
  "content": "User is an AI development engineer with 3 years of LLM application development experience."
}
\`\`\`

## preferences
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "preferences",
  "abstract": "Python code style: No type hints, concise and direct",
  "overview": "## Preference Domain\\n- Language: Python\\n- Topic: Code style\\n\\n## Details\\n- No type hints\\n- Concise function comments\\n- Direct implementation",
  "content": "User prefers Python code without type hints, with concise function comments."
}
\`\`\`

## cases
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "cases",
  "abstract": "LanceDB BigInt numeric handling issue",
  "overview": "## Problem\\nLanceDB 0.26+ returns BigInt for numeric columns\\n\\n## Solution\\nCoerce values with Number(...) before arithmetic",
  "content": "When LanceDB returns BigInt values, wrap them with Number() before doing arithmetic operations."
}
\`\`\`

# Output Format

Return JSON:

      "abstract": "One-line index",
      "overview": "Structured Markdown summary",
      "content": "Full narrative"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- Output language should match the dominant language in the conversation
- Only extract truly valuable personalized information
- If nothing worth recording, return {"memories": []}
- Maximum 5 memories per extraction
- Preferences should be aggregated by topic`;

export function buildDedupPrompt(candidateAbstract, candidateOverview, candidateContent, existingMemories) {
    return `Determine how to handle this candidate memory.

**Candidate Memory**:
Abstract: ${candidateAbstract}
Overview: ${candidateOverview}
Content: ${candidateContent}

**Existing Similar Memories**:
${existingMemories}

Please decide:
- SKIP: Candidate memory duplicates existing memories, no need to save. Also SKIP if the candidate contains LESS information than an existing memory on the same topic (information degradation — e.g., candidate says "programming language preference" but existing memory already says "programming language preference: Python, TypeScript")
- CREATE: This is completely new information not covered by any existing memory, should be created
- MERGE: Candidate memory adds genuinely NEW details to an existing memory and should be merged
- SUPERSEDE: Candidate states that the same mutable fact has changed over time. Keep the old memory as historical but no longer current, and create a new current memory.
- SUPPORT: Candidate reinforces/confirms an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. "still prefers tea in the evening")
- CONTEXTUALIZE: Candidate adds a situational nuance to an existing memory (e.g. existing: "likes coffee", candidate: "prefers tea at night" — different context, same topic)
- CONTRADICT: Candidate directly contradicts an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. existing: "runs on weekends", candidate: "stopped running on weekends")

IMPORTANT:
- "events" and "cases" categories are independent records — they do NOT support MERGE/SUPERSEDE/SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT. For these categories, only use SKIP or CREATE.
- If the candidate appears to be derived from a recall question (e.g., "Do you remember X?" / "你记得X吗？") and an existing memory already covers topic X with equal or more detail, you MUST choose SKIP.
- A candidate with less information than an existing memory on the same topic should NEVER be CREATED or MERGED — always SKIP.
- For "preferences" and "entities", use SUPERSEDE when the candidate replaces the current truth instead of adding detail or context. Example: existing "Preferred editor: VS Code", candidate "Preferred editor: Zed".
- For SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT, you MUST provide a context_label from this vocabulary: general, morning, evening, night, weekday, weekend, work, leisure, summer, winter, travel.

Return JSON format:
{
  "decision": "skip|create|merge|supersede|support|contextualize|contradict",
  "match_index": 1,
  "reason": "Decision reason",
  "context_label": "evening"
}

- If decision is "merge"/"supersede"/"support"/"contextualize"/"contradict", set "match_index" to the number of the existing memory (1-based).
- Only include "context_label" for support/contextualize/contradict decisions.`;

- merge: two or more rows are duplicates or near-duplicates of the same fact. Pick the row with the best-quality, most complete text as the survivor and list only the true duplicates as absorbed.
- supersede: one row is a newer fact or an explicit reversal that replaces one or more older rows describing the same fact (for example, a decision to stop doing something an older row describes). The survivor is the newer/reversal row; list only the rows it actually replaces as absorbed. Supersede is NOT destructive: absorbed rows are never deleted. They are kept as an auditable historical record and simply marked as no longer current, exactly like SUPERSEDE in ordinary dedup decisions ("the same mutable fact has changed over time; keep the old memory as historical but no longer current"). Use supersede whenever a row states that a fact from an older row has changed, even if that only applies to part of the cluster.
- contradict: two or more rows conflict and it is not clear which one is correct. Flag this for human review. No destructive action.

"events" and "cases" categories are append-only in this system: never list an append-only row as survivor_index or in absorbed_indices, but that never blocks you from merging or superseding the OTHER, actionable rows in the same cluster — just leave the append-only rows out of your selection.

Decision criteria: apply these checks in order for the rows in each cluster.
1. Do two or more rows say the same thing, with no row stating a newer fact, a change, or a reversal? -> merge.
2. Does one row explicitly state a fact has changed, ended, or reversed relative to another row (wording like "no longer", "stopped", "switched to", or simply a materially later timestamp describing a different state of the same fact)? -> supersede.
3. Do two or more rows assert mutually exclusive facts with no textual or temporal signal indicating which one is current? -> contradict.
4. None of the above apply to any rows in this cluster? -> skip.
When it is genuinely ambiguous whether a pair of rows should be merged or superseded, prefer supersede: it is the safer, fully-reversible choice, since a superseded row is retained as historical record rather than combined away into a single new record.
